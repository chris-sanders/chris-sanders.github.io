## The blog

Started in early 2018 and created to be intentionally minimal with each post
covering a discreet topic. I frequently find myself using technologies in unique
ways and wanted to have a platform to document these projects for myself as well
as share what I've learned with others. Hopefully you'll find something of
interest and maybe learn something along the way.

### Contact information
I'm not terribly active on social media if I'm not responding I'm
probably just not checking social media accounts. The footer has my various
