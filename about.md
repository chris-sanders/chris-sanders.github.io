## The blog

Started in early 2018 and created to be intentionally minimal with each post
covering a discreet topic. I frequently find myself using technologies in unique
ways and wanted to have a platform to document these projects for myself as well
as share what I've learned with others. Hopefully you'll find something of
interest and maybe even learn something along the way.

I'm a big fan of software that will just *do the right thing*&trade; and I'm
sure the blog posts will reflect that. Even when covering complex topics I try
to provide an out of box example that is opinionated to get you started quickly.

## About me

<!-- <img style="float: right;" src="/img/me.png"/> -->
My name is Chris Sanders, I'm an Engineering Manager at [Canonical][canonical],
most famously known as the creators of Ubuntu. My team isn't directly involved
with Ubuntu we're part of the [BootStack][bootstack] fully managed cloud
offering. I work closely with like minded engineers creating some of the most
forward looking cloud technologies available. I started this blog to document
some of these interesting use cases, particularly for non-enterprise
applications.


I'm from and have always lived in the United States. I'm currently located in
Huntsville, Alabama where there is a growing engineering community from a wide
variety of disciplines.

### Contact information
I'm not terribly active on social media if I'm not responding I'm
probably just not checking social media accounts. The footer has my various
contact accounts in it.
