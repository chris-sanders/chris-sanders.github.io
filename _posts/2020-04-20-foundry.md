With the world dealing with COVID-19 by social distancing many gaming groups are left looking
for ways to game while keeping their distance. This post will provide an overview for
installing Foundry Virtual Tabletop, a software specifically designed to support playing table
top games remotely with a group. I found [this overview][VTT-review] helpful in comparing
Virtual Table Top options. One unique feature of Foundry is it uses a self hosted one
time purchase model. In this post I'll be using the same tools I've used in previous posts
to deploy local or to the cloud provider of your choice.

## Setup
Since this post is targeted at people interested in Foundry I won't make the assumption you
are familiar with Juju, Charms, or LXD. If you are you can move onto the installation steps
below. For this setup I'm going to start from a clean Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) machine, if you
want to follow along.

While these tools have a lot of additional configuration options I will only go over what's
necessary to get started. You can dig into more advanced networks and configuration options
when/if needed at a later time.

### The tools
For this guide we'll install the software into [LXD][lxd] containers locally. This will let us test
out Foundry and the automation tools and remove the containers when we're done. The deployment
will utilize [Juju][juju] to manage the software and can be used to deploy on different
environments. While we're going to deploy locally on LXD the same tools and process can be
used to deploy to [a variety][cloud-providers] of cloud providers.

### Setup the local environment
We'll need LXD and Juju both of which can be installed as snaps.
```bash
# Instal snaps
sudo snap install lxd
sudo snap install juju --classic
# Setup lxd with defaults
lxd init --auto
# Verify LXD
lxc launch ubuntu:18.04
lxc list
```
This should install the dependencies and launch a test container. The final command `lxc list`
should provide a table showing your new container. 
```bash
+----------------+---------+------------------------+------+------------+-----------+
|      NAME      |  STATE  |        IPV4            | IPV6 |    TYPE    | SNAPSHOTS |
+----------------+---------+------------------------+------+------------+-----------+
| capital-martin | RUNNING | 10.177.243.208 (eth0)  |      | PERSISTENT | 0         |
+----------------+---------+------------------------+------+------------+-----------+
```
We don't need that container it was just a test, remove it with `lxc delete --force
capital-martin`, use the name that was generated for your container.

With LXD setup we'll establish a local Juju environment, the processes of setting up a
provider is known as bootstrapping.
```bash
juju bootstrap localhost lxd-controller
```
You can now check check the status of your juju environment with:
```bash
$ juju status
Model    Controller  Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp
default  local-lxd   localhost/localhost  2.7.5    unsupported  18:38:05-05:00

Model "admin/default" is empty.
```
You're all set, if you have any issues more detailed instructions are available on the [juju
lxd documentation][juju-lxd].

## Deploying
Let's start by deploying a bundle which will get the install running and then review the
details of what it is doing. A bundle is simply a yaml file that completely defines a set of
applications and options in a single file. Create a file named `bundle.yaml` with the
following contents in it.
```yaml
series: bionic
applications:
    foundry:
        charm: cs:~pirate-charmers/foundryvtt
        num_units: 1
        options:
            proxy_port: 80
        resources:
            foundryvtt: ./foundryvtt-0.5.5.zip
    haproxy:
        charm: cs:~pirate-charmers/haproxy
        num_units: 1
relations:
- - haproxy:reverseproxy
  - foundry:reverseproxy
```
Foundry currently distributes the software via [foundryvtt.com][foundry] and requires a one
time purchase. At the time of this writing it can be purchased as pre-release, with the
full launch planned for 2020-05-22. You will need the Zip file for Linux be sure the file is
in the same directory as the bundle.yaml and that the name of the file matches the filename
shown above. If you have a newer version simply update the name for the .zip file in the
bundle.yaml to match your file.

With the bundle.yaml and foundry.zip you can start the deploy:
```bash
juju deploy ./bundle.yaml
```
You can see the status of the install with `juju status --color`. I prefer to watch it for a
continual update `watch -c juju status --color --relations`.

When the deploy is finished you'll see a status that looks like:
```bash
Model    Controller  Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp
default  local-lxd   localhost/localhost  2.7.5    unsupported  19:36:38-05:00

## What was deployed
This bundle deploys two pieces of software.
 * FoundryVTT - The virtual table top server
 * Haproxy - Provides reverseproxy for FoundryVTT

This closely mirrors the configuration as described for setting up an Ubuntu VM on the
[community Wiki][foundry-wiki]. Where the instructions on the Wiki use NGINX I'm using HAProxy
both serve as a reverse proxy for Foundry.

Each software that Juju deploys is controlled via a piece of software known as a Charm. The
[HAProxy][haproxy-charm] and [FoundryVTT][foundry-charm] charms are publicly available and
manage the installation and operation of each of those pieces of software. In this case they
handle the setup much like the Wiki. Foundry installs Node, the provided Zip file, sets up a
daemon to keep it running, and registers with HAProxy. 

HAProxy has been installed and sets up the reverseproxy that is requested by Foundry.
This is done via a `relation` which is shown at the bottom of the bundle. The relation is a
known connection point between charms, in this case it's named `reverseproxy` and we've
connected Foundry to HAProxy as they both support the relation type.

In the `juju status` output you'll see a table with a section for **App**, **Unit**,
**Machine**, and **Relation**. Apps are the charms that are in the environment and tells you
where it was installed from (jujucharms) and the Revision. Units are an actual instance of the
application. In this case 'foundry/0' and 'haproxy/0'. The Units tell you the IP address they
currently have, what machine they are on, and some status about the unit. Machines are a list
of all machines in an environment where machines can be bare metal, containers, virtual
machines, etc. Machines aren't terribly interesting here, but on a cloud provider you might
install multiple units on a single virtual machine. Finally, a table of relations tells you
which relations currently exist, there is one as discussed above between haproxy and foundry.

## Accessing Foundry
With the deployment settled and all units showing active/idle we can access foundry. From the
status above we'll use the IP Address for HAProxy and the subdomain 'foundry' which is the
default set on the foundry charm. Open a browser to `http://foundry.10.177.243.63.xip.io` and
you should be greeted with the Activation Screen.

![Foundry Registration](/img/foundry/registration.png){:.img-shadow .img-rounded}

The use of [xip.io][xip] is a convenience domain that lets us use an IP address like a domain
name.

You can log into HAProxy or Foundry if you like with the `juju ssh` command. Also of interest
is `juju scp` which lets you copy files to/from machines. For example you might want to
copy a file to foundry to use as the background image for a world. You can do that with `juju
scp ./my-awesome-background.png foundry/0` or access foundry to see logs `juju ssh foundry/0`.
If you do put files on Foundry you'll find the data path the charm uses is `/opt/foundry/userdata`.

As I continue to update the Foundry charm additional actions for operating the software may
become available. Charms can be upgraded with `juju upgrade-charm` command allowing you to
pull in any fixes or changes. If you find bugs or features that should be part of the charm
you can file them on the [github][foundry-github] page for the charm. Additionally, I idle on
the Foundry [Discord server][foundry-discord] with the user name Zarek if you want to ping me on the
\#installation-support channel.

## Cleaning up
When you're done and want to remove the containers you can remove the model with all the
applications and machines and reset to a new clean default model with the command
`juju destroy-model -y default && juju add-model default`

From here you can redeploy with the same or new configurations if you like.

## Production use
With Juju you can target several [cloud providers][cloud-providers] to deploy your software
onto. With the same charms shown here you can deploy to whichever provider you prefer. For
self hosing in a lab environment the LXD or MAAS providers allow you to deploy to either
containers or bare metal machines of your choosing. I've run labs hosted on a single machine
as LXD containers as well as a multi-machine lab deployed with MAAS.

By default if the option `proxy_port` is not set it will use 443 to provide a secure
connection. The details of setting up HAProxy with Letsencrypt are beyond the scope of this
post but it is supported by the charm and an example of setting it up can be seen in the
previous blog post about [bundle weechat][bundle-weechat]. In that post, HAProxy was also
used, and the section **Accessing weechat via relay** walks through the use of `ddclient` and
`HAProxy` to setup a domain and Letsencrypt. As mentioned before feel free to ask questions
via Discord if you are ready to plan a roll out to a cloud provider or hardware in your lab.
Additionally, the weechat post demonstrates installing multiple charms on a single host with HAProxy
being deployed directly to the machine and other software in a LXD Container on the machine.
This same setup will let you run FoundryVTT and HAProxy on a single cloud machine.

In my experience if you deploy to a cloud provider the instance size needed to *run* the
software is not very high. However, I've seen instances that die during installation due to
lack of resource on small instances trying to install packages. One way to deal with that is
to install with a default machine size and after it's up and running shut the instance down
and resize to a smaller instance.
